## Description

Numbe One Fan is a collaborative project created as part of the University of Utah's full-stack developer bootcamp. It is intended to serve as a one-stop shop for music lovers to listen to and discover new music, save their favorite artists and albums, find upcoming concerts (for a specific artist or venue or the user's general location), and catalogue a user's attended concerts.

The entire application – both front- and back-end – was built from the ground up using the below user story, acceptance criteria, APIs, and languages.
